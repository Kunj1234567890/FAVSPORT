        <h1>I like to play badminton.</h1>
        <h3>Here are the rules of batminton:
            A player must wait until his opponent is ready before serving. 
            The feet of both players must remain in a stationary position until the serve is made. 
            It is not a fault if you miss the shuttle while serving.
            The shuttle cannot be caught and slung with the racket.
        </h3>
